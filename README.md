# PREDICTIVE-ANALYSIS-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
# Bengaluru House Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict house prices in Bengaluru using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various features like location, square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and more. The model helps users estimate house prices based on historical data and trends.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of:
- Location of the property
- Square footage (total area in square feet)
- Number of bedrooms (BHK)
- Number of bathrooms
- Availability status (Ready to move or Under construction)
- Price (dependent variable)

## Technologies Used
- *Python* (for data processing and model building)
- *Jupyter Notebook* (for experimentation and analysis)
- *Pandas & NumPy* (for data manipulation)
- *Matplotlib & Seaborn* (for data visualization)
- *Scikit-Learn* (for machine learning models)

## Steps Involved
1. *Data Preprocessing*: Handling missing values, feature encoding, and outlier removal.
2. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Understanding data distribution and correlation.
3. *Feature Engineering*: Creating meaningful features for better predictions.
4. *Model Selection*: Training and evaluating different machine learning models.
5. *Hyperparameter Tuning*: Optimizing the model for better accuracy.
6. *Predictions & Visualization*: Using the trained model to predict house prices and visualizing the results.

## Results
- Achieved an accurate price prediction model using regression techniques.
- Visualized the impact of different features on house prices.

## Future Enhancements
- Deploying the model as a web application.
- Using deep learning techniques for improved accuracy.
- Adding more features like crime rate, school ratings, etc.
